    <h1>Leading Causes of Death in the United States</h1>

    <p>
        This project analyzes data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
        to explore trends and patterns in mortality across the United States.
        Using interactive visualizations, we examine how causes of death vary over time,
        across states, and by age-adjusted rates.

    <h2>Visualization 1: Heart Disease Over Time</h2>

    <p>
        This line chart shows the age-adjusted death rate for heart disease in the United States
        over time. The visualization reveals a long-term decline followed by a recent increase,
        suggesting changes in public health trends.
