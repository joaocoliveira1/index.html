      <div class="insight">
        <p>
          This project presents an interactive data visualization analysis of the
          <strong>leading causes of death in the United States</strong> using mortality
          data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The visualizations
          examine how death rates change over time, how outcomes differ across states,
          and why <strong>age-adjusted death rates</strong> are essential for making fair
          comparisons between populations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than focusing only on which causes account for the most deaths, the analysis
          emphasizes underlying patterns such as <strong>long-term trends</strong>,
          <strong>geographic disparities</strong>, <strong>year-to-year variability</strong>,
          and the distinction between <strong>total deaths</strong>, <strong>crude rates</strong>,
          and <strong>age-adjusted death rates</strong>. Viewing mortality through multiple
          perspectives helps reveal insights that national averages alone can obscure.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website is designed for <strong>public health students</strong> and
          <strong>policymakers and public health officials</strong>. Students can use the
          visualizations to practice interpreting epidemiological data and developing
          research questions, while decision-makers can use them to identify where mortality
          burdens are concentrated, where progress has slowed, and where targeted
          interventions may have the greatest impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>Overview</strong> section summarizes major patterns across causes,
          the <strong>Geographic &amp; State-Level Disparities</strong> section highlights
          differences between states, and the <strong>Heart Disease Insights</strong> section
          provides a deeper examination of one of the most significant causes of death in
          the United States.

  <h2>Visualization 1: Heart Disease Over Time</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  This line chart shows the age-adjusted death rate for heart disease in the United States across multiple decades. The visualization reveals a strong and sustained decline from the late 1990s through the early 2010s, likely reflecting improvements in medical treatment, early detection, and public health interventions. In more recent years, the rate of decline slows and slightly reverses, suggesting that earlier gains may be plateauing. This pattern may indicate emerging challenges such as aging populations, lifestyle-related risk factors, or disparities in access to healthcare that are limiting further reductions in heart disease mortality.
</ul>
  <img src="viz1.png" alt="Visualization 1" />
</div>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 2: Treemap</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  The treemap displays the relative contribution of each major cause of death to overall mortality in the United States. It clearly shows that a small number of causes, most notably heart disease and cancer, account for a disproportionately large share of total deaths. This concentration highlights how overall mortality trends are heavily influenced by just a few dominant causes. The visualization also emphasizes that many other causes, while important, contribute relatively small portions individually, suggesting that targeted efforts focused on the leading causes could yield the greatest overall impact on national mortality.
</ul>
  <iframe src="viz2_treemap.html" title="Treemap"></iframe>
</div>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 3: Scatter Matrix</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  The scatter matrix illustrates relationships between total deaths, crude death rates, and age-adjusted death rates. While total deaths and crude rates tend to increase together, the visualization shows that age-adjusted rates often diverge, reflecting differences in population age structures. This highlights that high death counts do not always correspond to higher underlying mortality risk. The visualization reinforces the importance of age adjustment when comparing mortality across states or causes, as it allows for fairer comparisons that are not distorted by demographic differences.
</ul>
  <iframe src="viz3_scatter_matrix.html" title="Scatter Matrix"></iframe>
</div>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 4: Choropleth</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  This choropleth map visualizes how death rates for a selected cause vary across U.S. states. Clear geographic patterns emerge, with some regions consistently exhibiting higher mortality than others. These spatial differences suggest that mortality is influenced by more than just national-level factors and may be shaped by regional conditions such as healthcare access, economic inequality, environmental exposure, and cultural behaviors. The map demonstrates how location plays a critical role in shaping health outcomes and highlights the importance of state-level policy and intervention strategies.
</ul>
  <iframe src="viz4_choropleth.html" title="Choropleth"></iframe>
</div>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 5: Heatmap</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  The density heatmap shows how mortality levels for different causes fluctuate over time and whether multiple causes peak during the same periods. The visualization reveals that certain causes experience overlapping increases in mortality during specific years, suggesting the presence of shared external influences. These could include nationwide public health crises, environmental events, or systemic stressors affecting multiple health outcomes simultaneously. By highlighting synchronized patterns, the heatmap encourages deeper investigation into broader forces that may impact mortality across several causes at once.
</ul>
  <img src="viz5.png" alt="Visualization 5" />
</div>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 6: Box Plot</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  This box plot compares the year-to-year variability in total deaths across different causes. Some causes show narrow distributions, indicating relatively stable mortality trends over time, while others exhibit wider spreads and prominent outliers. These differences suggest that certain causes are more sensitive to short-term fluctuations or external shocks, such as epidemics or behavioral changes. The visualization helps distinguish between causes with predictable long-term patterns and those that may require closer monitoring due to volatility.
</ul>
  <img src="viz6.png" alt="Visualization 6" />
</div>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 7: Bubble Chart</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  The bubble chart combines multiple mortality metrics by plotting death rates while using bubble size to represent total deaths. The visualization demonstrates that causes or states with the highest number of deaths do not necessarily have the highest mortality rates once population size is accounted for. This contrast highlights how raw death counts can be misleading without contextual rate-based measures. By integrating magnitude and rate information, the chart provides a more nuanced understanding of mortality risk and emphasizes the importance of multidimensional analysis.
</ul>
  <iframe src="viz7_bubble_chart.html" title="Bubble Chart"></iframe>
</div>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 8: Age Impact Comparison</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  This bar chart compares age-adjusted death rates for causes that primarily affect older populations versus those impacting all age groups. The visualization suggests that causes associated with older populations tend to exhibit higher age-adjusted death rates, reflecting increased vulnerability with age. The inclusion of error bars highlights variability over time, reinforcing that these differences are not static. This comparison underscores the critical role of demographic structure in shaping mortality patterns and the importance of considering age when designing public health interventions.
</ul>
  <img src="viz8.png" alt="Visualization 8" />
</div>

  <div class="viz">
    <h2>Visualization 9: State-Level Line Map of Heart Disease Trends</h2>
    <ul class="insight">
  The line map illustrates how death rates for a specific cause evolve over time across different states. While many states follow similar overall trends, the visualization reveals meaningful differences in the timing and magnitude of changes. Some states show faster improvements, while others lag behind or experience slower declines. This suggests that national averages can mask important state-level dynamics and that localized policies, healthcare systems, and social conditions play a significant role in shaping mortality outcomes.
</ul>

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 10: Violin</h2>
  <ul class="insight">
  The violin plot displays the full distribution of death rates across states for a given cause, capturing both central tendencies and variability. The shape of the distribution reveals whether most states cluster around similar mortality levels or if substantial disparities exist. Long tails and asymmetries highlight outlier states with unusually high or low death rates compared to the national pattern. This visualization helps identify uneven health burdens across the country and points to areas that may require targeted investigation or intervention.

    <h3>Visualization 4: Heart Disease Age-Adjusted Death Rate by State (2017)</h3>
    <iframe src="viz4_choropleth.html" title="Choropleth"></iframe>

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        This choropleth map reveals pronounced geographic disparities in heart disease mortality across the
        United States in 2017. Rather than a uniform national pattern, heart disease death rates cluster
        regionally, with several states—particularly in parts of the Southeast and Midwest—exhibiting
        substantially higher age-adjusted rates than states in the West and Northeast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the data are age-adjusted, these differences cannot be explained simply by older populations.
        Instead, the map points to deeper structural and social factors shaping cardiovascular health outcomes,
        including differences in socioeconomic status, access to preventive care, prevalence of chronic conditions
        such as obesity and diabetes, dietary patterns, physical activity environments, and the strength of
        state-level public health systems. The visualization demonstrates that where someone lives plays a critical
        role in their risk of dying from heart disease.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This map provides a clear visual foundation for studying health disparities and regional inequality.
          Students can use it to explore how social determinants of health, healthcare access, and policy
          environments contribute to uneven outcomes, and to compare high- and low-performing states for deeper
          causal analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          By identifying states with persistently high heart disease mortality, this visualization supports targeted
          intervention rather than national one-size-fits-all solutions. Officials can use the map to prioritize
          funding, tailor prevention programs, and evaluate whether existing state-level policies are effectively
          reducing cardiovascular risk.
        </li>

    <h3>Visualization 6: Box Plot — Annual Variability in Death Rates by Cause</h3>
    <img src="viz6.png" alt="Box Plot">

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        This box plot highlights how stable or volatile mortality rates are for major causes of death over time.
        Causes such as heart disease and cancer have relatively narrow interquartile ranges, indicating that
        although their death rates are high, they tend to change gradually from year to year. This reflects the
        chronic nature of these conditions and the slow-moving influence of medical advances and population-level
        risk factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, causes like stroke and unintentional injuries display greater variability, with wider spreads
        and more extreme values. This suggests that mortality for these causes is more sensitive to short-term
        factors such as policy changes, environmental conditions, economic shifts, or sudden public health shocks.
        The log scale further emphasizes that variability matters not just in absolute terms, but proportionally
        across causes.

      <p><strong>Who benefits &amp; what they can do</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This visualization helps students distinguish between causes driven by long-term structural trends and those
          that are more responsive to short-term interventions. It encourages thinking about predictability, volatility,
          and how different health outcomes respond differently to policy and environmental changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          Causes with higher variability require flexible and responsive policy planning, as sudden changes can quickly
          increase mortality. More stable causes, while less volatile, demand sustained long-term investment. This chart
          supports strategic planning by showing where rapid-response capacity versus long-term prevention is most critical.

    <h3>Visualization 9: State-Level Heart Disease Death Rate Trends Over Time (Line Map)</h3>
    <iframe src="viz9_line_map.html" title="State Trends"></iframe>

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        While national averages suggest a single shared story, this state-level visualization reveals a far more complex
        reality. Although most states experienced declining heart disease mortality, the speed, timing, and consistency of
        those declines vary substantially. Some states show early and sustained improvements, while others decline more
        slowly or flatten earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        These differences highlight the importance of local context. Variations in healthcare infrastructure, insurance
        coverage, preventive screening, socioeconomic conditions, diet, physical activity environments, and state-level
        public health policies all contribute to divergent outcomes. The visualization demonstrates that heart disease is
        not just a national issue but a geographically uneven one, shaped by where people live as much as by individual
        risk factors.

      <p><strong>Who benefits &amp; what they can do</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This map encourages students to move beyond national narratives and think spatially about health outcomes. It supports
          comparative analysis between states and invites investigation into how policy, funding, and social conditions translate
          into measurable mortality differences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          By identifying states that lag behind or plateau earlier, this visualization helps target state-specific interventions.
          Officials can benchmark their state against peers, evaluate which policies are associated with faster improvements, and
          justify reallocating resources toward regions where heart disease remains persistently high.

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        The violin plot reveals how death rates are distributed across states for each cause, moving beyond averages to show the
        full range of outcomes. For heart disease and cancer, the wide shapes indicate substantial state-to-state variation, meaning
        that while national averages appear stable, individual states experience very different mortality burdens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long tails and asymmetry in several violins highlight the presence of outlier states with unusually high or low death rates.
        This suggests that national statistics can obscure localized crises or successes. The visualization underscores that mortality
        risk is unevenly distributed and heavily influenced by state-level conditions such as healthcare access, socioeconomic
        inequality, and public health infrastructure.

          This chart helps students understand distributional thinking—why means alone are insufficient and how disparities manifest
          across geographic units. It encourages analysis of why certain states fall into the tails of the distribution.

          The violin plot supports benchmarking and targeted action. States in the upper tails may require urgent intervention, while
          lower-performing states can serve as models for effective policies and prevention strategies.

      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        This visualization highlights one of the most significant public health successes in recent U.S. history:
        a sustained decline in heart disease mortality from the late 1990s through the early 2010s. The steady
        downward trend reflects the combined impact of advances in cardiovascular medicine, widespread
        risk-factor awareness, and large-scale public health interventions targeting smoking, cholesterol,
        and blood pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the slowdown and slight reversal in more recent years is particularly important. Rather than
        continued improvement, the trend begins to plateau, signaling that earlier strategies may be reaching
        diminishing returns. Emerging challenges such as rising obesity and diabetes rates, sedentary lifestyles,
        population aging, and unequal access to preventive care are increasingly offsetting past gains. This
        marks a transition from rapid improvement to a period where progress is more difficult and uneven.

          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This chart provides a clear example of how population-level health outcomes respond to policy,
          medical innovation, and behavioral change over time. Students can use it to frame research questions
          about why declines slowed, compare heart disease to other causes of death, and explore the limits of
          traditional prevention strategies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          The plateau serves as a warning signal, suggesting that maintaining progress will require new
          approaches—such as addressing social determinants of health, expanding preventive care in
          underserved populations, and shifting from treatment-focused strategies to long-term lifestyle
          and environmental interventions.

    <h3>Visualization 4: Heart Disease Age-Adjusted Death Rate by State (2017)</h3>

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        This choropleth map reveals pronounced geographic disparities in heart disease mortality across the
        United States in 2017. Rather than a uniform national pattern, death rates cluster regionally, with
        several states—particularly in parts of the Southeast and Midwest—exhibiting substantially higher
        age-adjusted rates than states in the West and Northeast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the data are age-adjusted, these differences cannot be explained simply by older populations.
        Instead, the map points to deeper structural and social factors shaping cardiovascular health outcomes,
        including socioeconomic conditions, access to preventive care, prevalence of chronic diseases such as
        obesity and diabetes, dietary patterns, physical activity environments, and the strength of state-level
        public health systems. The visualization makes clear that where someone lives plays a major role in
        their risk of dying from heart disease.

          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This map provides a strong visual foundation for studying health disparities and regional inequality.
          Students can compare high- and low-performing states, investigate policy differences, and analyze
          how social determinants translate into measurable mortality outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          By identifying states with persistently high heart disease mortality, this visualization supports
          targeted intervention rather than national one-size-fits-all solutions. Officials can use it to
          prioritize funding, tailor prevention programs, and evaluate whether existing policies are effectively
          reducing cardiovascular risk.

    <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
    <div class="insight">
      <p>
        Together, these visualizations show that while heart disease mortality has declined nationally,
        sustaining and extending these gains will depend on targeted, state-level policies that address
        emerging risk factors and persistent health disparities.
