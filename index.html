    <h3>Visualization 4: Heart Disease Age-Adjusted Death Rate by State (2017)</h3>
    <iframe src="viz4_choropleth.html" title="Choropleth"></iframe>

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        This choropleth map reveals pronounced geographic disparities in heart disease mortality across the
        United States in 2017. Rather than a uniform national pattern, heart disease death rates cluster
        regionally, with several states—particularly in parts of the Southeast and Midwest—exhibiting
        substantially higher age-adjusted rates than states in the West and Northeast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the data are age-adjusted, these differences cannot be explained simply by older populations.
        Instead, the map points to deeper structural and social factors shaping cardiovascular health outcomes,
        including differences in socioeconomic status, access to preventive care, prevalence of chronic conditions
        such as obesity and diabetes, dietary patterns, physical activity environments, and the strength of
        state-level public health systems. The visualization demonstrates that where someone lives plays a critical
        role in their risk of dying from heart disease.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This map provides a clear visual foundation for studying health disparities and regional inequality.
          Students can use it to explore how social determinants of health, healthcare access, and policy
          environments contribute to uneven outcomes, and to compare high- and low-performing states for deeper
          causal analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          By identifying states with persistently high heart disease mortality, this visualization supports targeted
          intervention rather than national one-size-fits-all solutions. Officials can use the map to prioritize
          funding, tailor prevention programs, and evaluate whether existing state-level policies are effectively
          reducing cardiovascular risk.

    <h3>Visualization 6: Box Plot — Annual Variability in Death Rates by Cause</h3>
    <img src="viz6.png" alt="Box Plot">

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        This box plot highlights how stable or volatile mortality rates are for major causes of death over time.
        Causes such as heart disease and cancer have relatively narrow interquartile ranges, indicating that
        although their death rates are high, they tend to change gradually from year to year. This reflects the
        chronic nature of these conditions and the slow-moving influence of medical advances and population-level
        risk factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, causes like stroke and unintentional injuries display greater variability, with wider spreads
        and more extreme values. This suggests that mortality for these causes is more sensitive to short-term
        factors such as policy changes, environmental conditions, economic shifts, or sudden public health shocks.
        The log scale further emphasizes that variability matters not just in absolute terms, but proportionally
        across causes.

      <p><strong>Who benefits &amp; what they can do</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This visualization helps students distinguish between causes driven by long-term structural trends and those
          that are more responsive to short-term interventions. It encourages thinking about predictability, volatility,
          and how different health outcomes respond differently to policy and environmental changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          Causes with higher variability require flexible and responsive policy planning, as sudden changes can quickly
          increase mortality. More stable causes, while less volatile, demand sustained long-term investment. This chart
          supports strategic planning by showing where rapid-response capacity versus long-term prevention is most critical.

    <h3>Visualization 9: State-Level Heart Disease Death Rate Trends Over Time (Line Map)</h3>
    <iframe src="viz9_line_map.html" title="State Trends"></iframe>

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        While national averages suggest a single shared story, this state-level visualization reveals a far more complex
        reality. Although most states experienced declining heart disease mortality, the speed, timing, and consistency of
        those declines vary substantially. Some states show early and sustained improvements, while others decline more
        slowly or flatten earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        These differences highlight the importance of local context. Variations in healthcare infrastructure, insurance
        coverage, preventive screening, socioeconomic conditions, diet, physical activity environments, and state-level
        public health policies all contribute to divergent outcomes. The visualization demonstrates that heart disease is
        not just a national issue but a geographically uneven one, shaped by where people live as much as by individual
        risk factors.

      <p><strong>Who benefits &amp; what they can do</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This map encourages students to move beyond national narratives and think spatially about health outcomes. It supports
          comparative analysis between states and invites investigation into how policy, funding, and social conditions translate
          into measurable mortality differences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          By identifying states that lag behind or plateau earlier, this visualization helps target state-specific interventions.
          Officials can benchmark their state against peers, evaluate which policies are associated with faster improvements, and
          justify reallocating resources toward regions where heart disease remains persistently high.

    <h3>Visualization 10: Violin Plot — State Distribution of Death Rates by Cause (2017)</h3>
    <img src="viz10.png" alt="Violin Plot">

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        The violin plot reveals how death rates are distributed across states for each cause, moving beyond averages to show the
        full range of outcomes. For heart disease and cancer, the wide shapes indicate substantial state-to-state variation, meaning
        that while national averages appear stable, individual states experience very different mortality burdens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long tails and asymmetry in several violins highlight the presence of outlier states with unusually high or low death rates.
        This suggests that national statistics can obscure localized crises or successes. The visualization underscores that mortality
        risk is unevenly distributed and heavily influenced by state-level conditions such as healthcare access, socioeconomic
        inequality, and public health infrastructure.

          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This chart helps students understand distributional thinking—why means alone are insufficient and how disparities manifest

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          The violin plot supports benchmarking and targeted action. States in the upper tails may require urgent intervention, while
          lower-performing states can serve as models for effective policies and prevention strategies.

    <div class="insight">
      <p><strong>Deeper Insight</strong></p>
      <p>
        This visualization highlights one of the most significant public health successes in recent U.S. history:
        a sustained decline in heart disease mortality from the late 1990s through the early 2010s. The steady
        downward trend reflects the combined impact of advances in cardiovascular medicine, widespread
        risk-factor awareness, and large-scale public health interventions targeting smoking, cholesterol,
        and blood pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the slowdown and slight reversal in more recent years is particularly important. Rather than
        continued improvement, the trend begins to plateau, signaling that earlier strategies may be reaching
        diminishing returns. Emerging challenges such as rising obesity and diabetes rates, sedentary lifestyles,
        population aging, and unequal access to preventive care are increasingly offsetting past gains. This
        marks a transition from rapid improvement to a period where progress is more difficult and uneven.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public health students:</strong>
          This chart provides a clear example of how population-level health outcomes respond to policy,
          medical innovation, and behavioral change over time. Students can use it to frame research questions
          about why declines slowed, compare heart disease to other causes of death, and explore the limits of
          traditional prevention strategies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          The plateau serves as a warning signal, suggesting that maintaining progress will require new
          approaches—such as addressing social determinants of health, expanding preventive care in
          underserved populations, and shifting from treatment-focused strategies to long-term lifestyle
          and environmental interventions.

        United States in 2017. Rather than a uniform national pattern, death rates cluster regionally, with
        several states—particularly in parts of the Southeast and Midwest—exhibiting substantially higher
        age-adjusted rates than states in the West and Northeast.

        Because the data are age-adjusted, these differences cannot be explained simply by older populations.
        Instead, the map points to deeper structural and social factors shaping cardiovascular health outcomes,
        including socioeconomic conditions, access to preventive care, prevalence of chronic diseases such as
        obesity and diabetes, dietary patterns, physical activity environments, and the strength of state-level
        public health systems. The visualization makes clear that where someone lives plays a major role in
        their risk of dying from heart disease.

          This map provides a strong visual foundation for studying health disparities and regional inequality.
          Students can compare high- and low-performing states, investigate policy differences, and analyze
          how social determinants translate into measurable mortality outcomes.

          <strong>Policymakers &amp; public health officials:</strong>
          By identifying states with persistently high heart disease mortality, this visualization supports
          targeted intervention rather than national one-size-fits-all solutions. Officials can use it to
          prioritize funding, tailor prevention programs, and evaluate whether existing policies are effectively
          reducing cardiovascular risk.

    <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
    <div class="insight">
      <p>
        Together, these visualizations show that while heart disease mortality has declined nationally,
        sustaining and extending these gains will depend on targeted, state-level policies that address
        emerging risk factors and persistent health disparities.
