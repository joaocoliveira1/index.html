  <h1>Leading Causes of Death in the United States</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    This project analyzes National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data to explore trends and patterns in U.S. mortality
    across time, states, and age-adjusted death rates.
  </p>

  <h2>Visualization 1: Heart Disease Over Time</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    This line chart shows the age-adjusted death rate for heart disease in the United States over time. The visualization reveals a strong long-term decline in heart disease mortality from the late 1990s through the early 2010s. In the most recent years, the decline appears to slow and slightly level off, with a small uptick in some years. This suggests that while medical advances and prevention efforts significantly reduced heart disease deaths for many years, progress may have stalled recently, potentially reflecting changing public health conditions or lifestyle factors.

  <h2>Visualization 2: Treemap</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    This treemap displays the relative proportions of the leading causes of death in the United States. The visualization highlights that a small number of causes, such as heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory diseases, account for a disproportionately large share of total deaths. This emphasizes how mortality in the U.S. is heavily concentrated among a few major causes, while many other causes contribute comparatively smaller portions.

  <h2>Visualization 3: Scatter Matrix</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    The scatter matrix compares relationships among total deaths, crude death rates, and age-adjusted death rates. The visualization shows that while total deaths and crude death rates are often positively related, age-adjusted death rates can differ substantially, indicating the influence of population age structure. This demonstrates why age adjustment is important when comparing mortality patterns across states or causes.

  <h2>Visualization 4: Choropleth</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    This choropleth map illustrates how death rates for a selected cause vary across U.S. states. The visualization reveals clear geographic patterns, with certain regions consistently exhibiting higher mortality rates than others. These differences suggest that location-specific factors, such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic conditions, or lifestyle differences, may play an important role in shaping mortality outcomes.

  <h2>Visualization 5: Heatmap</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    The density heatmap shows how different causes of death fluctuate over time and whether they peak in similar years. The visualization reveals that some causes exhibit overlapping periods of higher mortality, suggesting the possibility of shared external influences such as environmental events, public health crises, or policy changes. This supports further investigation into common drivers affecting multiple causes simultaneously.

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 6: Box Plot</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    This box plot compares the annual variability in total deaths across different causes. Some causes show tight distributions, indicating relatively stable mortality from year to year, while others display wider spreads and outliers. This suggests that certain causes are more sensitive to short-term changes or external shocks, whereas others follow more predictable long-term patterns.

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 7: Bubble Chart</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    This bubble chart compares mortality measures by plotting death rates while using bubble size to represent total deaths. The visualization highlights that some causes or states with very large numbers of deaths do not necessarily have the highest age-adjusted or crude death rates, while others with smaller populations show disproportionately high rates. This pattern reinforces that population size strongly influences total death counts and demonstrates why combining magnitude (bubble size) with rate-based measures provides a more accurate and nuanced understanding of mortality risk.

  <div class="viz">
  <h2>Visualization 8: Age Impact Comparison</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    This bar chart compares age-adjusted death rates for causes that primarily affect older populations versus those affecting all age groups. The visualization suggests that causes associated with older populations tend to have higher age-adjusted death rates, reflecting the increased vulnerability of aging populations. Error bars highlight variability and uncertainty, reinforcing that these patterns are general trends rather than exact values.

    <h2>Visualization 9: State-Level Line Map of Heart Disease Trends</h2>
    <p class="insight">
      This geographic line map shows how age-adjusted death rates for heart disease evolve over time across U.S. states.
      Each line represents a state, allowing direct comparison of long-term trends rather than single-year snapshots.
      While many states follow a general national decline, the slope and timing of changes vary considerably, highlighting
      meaningful state-level differences that are masked in national averages.

  <h2>Visualization 10: Violin</h2>
  <p class="insight">
    The violin plot displays the distribution of death rates across states for a given cause. The visualization highlights both the spread and density of values, revealing whether most states cluster around similar rates or if there are substantial outliers. This helps identify causes where certain states experience unusually high or low mortality compared to the national pattern.
